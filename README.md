## Setup Instructions

To get started with the Locations 3D System, follow these steps:

1. **Install Node.js**: Download and install the latest version of Node.js from [Node.js Official Website](https://nodejs.org/).

2. **Install Parcel**: Parcel is used as a bundler for this project. Install it globally by running `npm install -g parcel-bundler` in your terminal.

3. **Clone the Repository**: Clone the Locations 3D System repository to your local machine using the command `git clone https://github.com/your-repository/locations-3d-system.git`.

4. **Navigate to the Project Directory**: Open a terminal window and navigate to the directory of the cloned repository by executing `cd locations-3d-system`.

5. **Install Dependencies**: Run `npm install` in the project directory to install all the required dependencies.

6. **Start the Development Server**: Execute `parcel index.html` to start the local development server. This command compiles the project and serves it on a local web server.

7. **Open the Application**: Open your web browser and go to `http://localhost:1234` to view the Locations 3D System. The port number may vary, so check the terminal output for the exact URL.

8. **Explore the System**: Interact with the 3D map.

9. **Make Modifications**: Modify the source files as needed. Parcel will automatically rebuild the project when you save your changes.
